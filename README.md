# SM64 Co-op Mods
Some mods I created for sm64ex-coop. Mostly cheats and random stuff that can make your life easier or stuff I randomly made for no reason other than just for fun.

All models, romhacks and texture mods are simply ports, they are not originally created by me.

All mods are compatible with sm64coopdx too.

## Coin Star Mods
1CoinStar.lua - Simply only requires you to get 1 coin in order to get the coin star [ARCHIVED]

1RedCoin.lua - The exact same but for red coins [ARCHIVED]

1C1RC.lua - A combination of the two above [ARCHIVED]

coinreqmod.lua - Allows you to modify the number of coins/red coins required using commands
>Sure does make your life easier. No need to run around and grind all those coins.

## Death and Restart Mods
PressXToDie.lua - Pressing X will kill you [ARCHIVED]

PressXToRestart.lua - Pressing X will restart the level [ARCHIVED]

X2DY2R.lua - Press X to die and Y to restart [ARCHIVED]
>These are not the actual X and Y keys on your keyboard but rather whatever button you mapped them to (You'll find the option in Controls --> Extra Binds)

die.lua - Type /die to die [ARCHIVED]

restart.lua - Type /restart to restart the level [ARCHIVED]

dierestart.lua - A combination of the two above
>Simply more efficient.

## Easy Bubble Mod
easybubble.lua - Allows you to bubble and unbubble anywhere you want without the need to be near another player
>This mod only works in multiplayer because in singleplayer, bubbling would just straight up kill you, therefore I had to disable the ability to bubble in singleplayer. You can still keep the mod enabled though, it just won't work in singleplayer at all. Enjoy floating around the entire level and going to places that are impossible to reach!

## SM64 Remixed
This mod adds custom music to every level. Mostly cool SM64 versions of popular songs.
